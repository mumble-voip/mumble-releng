win32-static build environment
==============================

This document will help you get an up-to-date 'static' Mumble build environment on Windows.
A FAQ section is available near the end of the document.

Requirements
------------

	* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 (We recommend Community, which is free for open source work)
	* Windows 10 SDK
	* Git in your Windows PATH. We only test with the official git-scm.org packages.

If you intend to build the x86 version of this buildenv ("win32-static"),
which targets Windows XP and above, you'll also need:

	* Direct X SDK (June 2010)


Performing the installation
---------------------------

  1. Creating c:\MumbleBuild

  The Mumble buildenv expects to live in c:\MumbleBuild.
  This is simply a convention, which you can override if you modify the
  setup script yourself.

  The main technical reason for doing it is to make the buildenvs redistributable.
  Some programs might hardcode absolute paths in their build files, making it hard
  to re-use an environment on another machine.

  If you have enough space on your c: drive, feel free to simply create the MumbleBuild
  directory there.

  If you have more space on another drive, you can junction a MumbleBuild directory from
  there onto c:\MumbleBuild. Open a admin command prompt [Ctrl-X followed by A on Win 8+]
  and ensure you're at the root of C:, and run
	
      c:\> mklink /j MumbleBuild d:\MumbleBuild

  replacing d:\MumbleBuild with where you want your REAL MumbleBuild directory to live.

  2. Install the build environment
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Double click on the setup.cmd script that lives in the same
  directory as this README file.

  This should install a Mumble build environment in c:\MumbleBuild in
  a directory named according to the commit hash and date of the latest
  change to the win32-static build environment. A typical target path
  will look something like this:

      c:\MumbleBuild\win32-static-1.3.x-2017-01-16-8f22294-821

  After installation finishes, Windows Explorer should open up the directory
  to which it installed the build environment.

  (If this does not happen, we recommend you troubleshoot what's going on
   by running setup.cmd from a command prompt.  You can easily spawn one
   by right clicking while holding down shift in the Windows Explorer window
   you're using to browse the win32-static directory.)

  The setup script will have created two shortcuts in the build environment
  for running the build environent via either Cygwin or Windows cmd.exe.
  The Cygwin one is needed to run the build scripts that build all Mumble's
  dependencies. The cmd.exe one will be used to build Mumble itself.

  3. Building the dependencies
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  To start building Mumble's dependencies, double-click the "MumbleBuild - cygwin"
  shortcut.

  In the Cygwin shell, type the following:

     $ cd mumble-releng/buildenv/1.3.x/win32-static

  to change directory to the build environment's local clone of the mumble-releng
  repository.

  After this, you're ready to start building all Mumble and Murmur's dependencies.
  You can start the process by running the "build-all.bash" script:

    $ ./build-all.bash

  This can be quite a lengthy process since Mumble has quite a few dependencies, and
  some of them can take a while to build.

  Once all dependencies are built, you will be returned to your Cygwin shell.

  You can double check that everything has been built by inspecting the build
  environment's root directory. You should see a lot of folders containing
  installed/built products for all of the Mumble dependencies.

  You can also click on the shortcut to the "build+src" directory. This will
  navigate to the directory in which the build environment keeps around
  source code (both in extracted form, as well as the pristine downloaded archives),
  object code, debug symbols (.PDBs) and more. This directory should obviously also
  be full of tarballs, zip files, directories and so on. 

  4. Building Mumble itself
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  To build Mumble itself using your newly-built build environment, you should use the
  "MumbleBuild - cmd" shortcut to launch a Windows command prompt.

  Make a checkout of the Mumble source tree and enter the root of the source tree.

    c:\users\builder> git clone --recursive https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble.git

      [...]

    c:\users\builder> cd mumble

  To generate Makefiles for use with the build environment, run the following:

    c:\users\builder\mumble> qmake -recursive main.pro CONFIG+="release static tests warnings-as-errors no-elevation"

  And finally, do the build itself:

    c:\users\builder\mumble> jom

  You should end up with a mumble.exe and a murmur.exe binary (and a whole collection of .DLL
  files to go along with the two) in the "release" directory in the root of the Mumble source
  tree.

FAQ
===

  Q:  Do I need to keep the build+src directory around? (MumbleBuild-XXXXX-YY-MM-DD.build)

  A:  Yes, we'd advise you to. During the compilation of the various Mumble dependencies
      in the build environment, "object file" .PDBs (that is, .PDBs that are created by CL.exe
      and *not* "linker PDBs" by LINK.EXE) will be generated for all built libraries.

      The paths to these object file .PDBs are all hardcoded into the object files themselves
      in the form of an absolute path.

      When statically linking your final Mumble and Murmur executables, these intermediate
      .PDBs will be included in the .PDB file generated for all of Mumble's executables
      and .DLLs.

      Therefore, if you remove the build+src directory, you'll most likely lose the ability
      to debug or get valuable crash information from your Mumble builds.

      However, if you don't care about source, and want to save space, you can use the
      cleanup-buildenv-build-dir.py script in the tools directory of the mumble-releng repo.
